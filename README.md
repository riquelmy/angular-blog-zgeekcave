# Pokedex 
**Zgeek Cave** is a blog project I did for **DIO (Digital Innovation One)**'s Full Stack Bootcamp. I built it with the framework Angular and I practiced a lot of concepts related to components.

## Overview

The challenge of the bootcamp was to build a blog project to practice the skills I have learned so far with Angular (that being, directives, components, routes, life-cycle hooks, dynamic elements). To do it, I used as inspiration Dwinawan's blog layout on <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/18089191-Blog-Layout" target="_blank">Dribble</a>

**Technologies/Tools used in it**: Git, Github, Node.js, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, VsCode
